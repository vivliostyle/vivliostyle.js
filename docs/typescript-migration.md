Vivliostyle.js changed its type check system from Google Closure Compiler to TypeScript.

The pre-migration JS source code has been moved to the [old-js-src](https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle.js/tree/old-js-src) branch.

About the migration work, see the [JS-to-TS migration](https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle.js/milestone/1) milestone.
